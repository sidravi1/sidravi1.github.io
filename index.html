	<h1>Hi, welcome to my site.</h1>
	<p>I use this site to blog about interesting and fun statistical methods.
		I enjoy CS, statistics, machine learning, and development economics.
		I currently work at QuantumBlack as a data scientist.
		Previously, I worked at the Center for International Development
		at Harvard as a Growth Lab Fellow where I worked on economic complexity
		and diversification. Any opinions presented here are entirely mine and
		do not represent the views of my employer.
