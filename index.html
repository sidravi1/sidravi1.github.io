	<h1>Hi, welcome to my site.</h1>
	<p>I use this site to blog about interesting and fun statistical methods.
		Things I love: big cookups with my wife, long conversations with my daughter,
		being outside, good beer with friends, squash, CS, statistics, machine learning, Avatar
		the Last Airbender, Star `[a-zA-Z]{4}$`, and development economics.
		<br><br>
		I work at QuantumBlack as a data scientist.
		Previously, I worked at the Center for International Development
		at Harvard as a Growth Lab Fellow where I worked on economic complexity
		and diversification. I am a graduate of the MPA/ID program at Harvard Kennedy
		School which introduced me to a third of the list of things I love today. I studied Electric
		Engineering at University of Melbourne as an undergrad but I barely remember
		that stuff.
		<br><br>
		Any opinions presented here are entirely mine and
		do not represent the views of my employer.
