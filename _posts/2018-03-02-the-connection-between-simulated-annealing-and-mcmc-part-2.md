If you didn't see [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-01-the-connection-between-simulated-annealing-and-mcmc-part-1 %}), check that out first.

I did promise an actual example. [Here's an example](https://github.com/sidravi1/Blog/blob/master/nbs/SA_to_Metropolis_Example.ipynb) of using SA for a simple Nurse Scheduling Problem.

I want to talk a little bit more about this line:

{% highlight python %}
alpha = min(1, e^((E_old - E_new)/T) # (3)
{% endhighlight %}

Let's explore what exactly is going on here. Say we have a function *f(x)* as follows:

$$

f(x) = -5(x)^2 + \frac{1}{6} \cdot x^3 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot x^4 + 20

$$

Let's see what this looks like:

![f(x)]({{"/assets/01_fx.png" | absolute_url}})

So we have a local minimum and a global minimum. Now let's see what the values of *alpha* is as we change T (I have removed alpha = 1 for clarity). I have generated a bunch of random points for $x_{old}$ and $x_{new}$ between -3 and 3.

![histogram of alpha as T reduces]({{"/assets/01_alpha.png" | absolute_url}})

Alpha is closer to 1 when temperature is high and is closer to 0 when temperature is low.  Alpha comes into play here:

{% highlight python %}
if (E_new < E_old) or (alpha > threshold):
{% endhighlight %}

where threshold was drawn from a uniform distribution. In terms of our example, if  $f\left(x_{new}\right)$ is less than $f\left(x_{old}\right)$ then accept. If not, check if *alpha* is greater than the random draw. If temperature is high and we're getting *alphas* around 0.9, they'll be accepted around 90% of the time.  If temperature is low and we're getting *alphas* around 0, then almost none will get accepted.

So when temperature is high, we accept an *x* even if *f(x)*   is higher than our current estimate. The importance of the proposal function being able to 'communicate' between any two points is clear now. If not, we'll never propose an *x* way out there, and we'll never explore that part of the space. We'll be stuck around our current minima.

Finally, what exactly does $e^{f(x)/T}$ look like?

![Boltzmann distributions]({{"/assets/01_efx.png" | absolute_url}})

Note that the y-axes have different scales. When temperature is high, the difference between being in different regions is not that great. Which means that $\frac{e^{f(x_{old})/T}}{e^{f(x_{new})/T}}$ is around 1.  Later on, it resembles a delta function where unless you are proposing something very very close to global minimum, you're getting an *alpha* of pretty much 0 which means you're now just fine tuning around the minimum.

Actually, what we are doing is drawing from a different Boltzmann distribution at each T:

$$
\displaystyle p_{i}={\frac {e^{-{\varepsilon }_{i}/kT}}{\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{M}{e^{-{\varepsilon }_{j}/kT}}}}
$$

Note that the denominator term just normalizes the distribution and we use k=1.

Wait, we are drawing from a distribution? So can we draw from any other distribution? That leads us nicely to sampling using Metropolis. You can head on to Part 3 or if you need a little motivation, check out this post on [Monte Carlo methods]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-11-monte-carlo-methods %}) and this one on [Why MCMC (and intro to Markov Chains)]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-03-03-why-mcmc-and-a-quick-markov-chains-intro %}).
