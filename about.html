	<h1>Hi, welcome to my site.</h1>
	<p>I use this site to blog about interesting/fun statistical methods and algorithms.
		It's basically a dump of my experiments in varying stages of maturity.
		Most of my implementations are loosely related to Bayesian Statistics. Everything
		just made sense when I discovered it.
		<br><br>
		Things I love: learning, big cookups with my wife, long conversations with my daughter,
		being outside, good beer with friends, squash, puzzles, CS, statistics, machine learning,
		Avatar the Last Airbender, Star `[a-zA-Z]{4}$`, and development economics.
		<br><br>
		I work at QuantumBlack as a data scientist.
		Previously, I worked at the Center for International Development
		at Harvard as a Growth Lab Fellow where I worked on economic complexity
		and diversification. I have worked in International Development (Ghana, PNG, Uganda,
		and India mainly) for many years and I hope to someday go back to it.
		<br><br>
		I am a graduate of the MPA/ID program at Harvard Kennedy School where I studied
		Development Economics, Econometrics, and Data Science. I studied Electric
		Engineering at University of Melbourne as an undergrad and I'm working hard to remember
		all the stuff I learnt.
		<br><br>
		Any opinions presented here are entirely mine and
		do not represent the views of my employer.
